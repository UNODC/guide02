    <h3>10. Controlled Deliveries</h3>

    <p>Controlled deliveries are a useful technique allowing you to follow the movement of illicit goods and may help
        to identify the destination of contraband and people involved in trafficking.</p>

    <p>Consider these steps when planning a controlled delivery:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Do you have the appropriate authority to conduct the controlled delivery?</li>
        <li>Do you have cooperation from national and international counterparts?</li>
        <li>Is there sufficient time to launch an operation?</li>
        <li>Be careful not to disturb the good arousing suspicion.</li>
        <li>Replace some of the contraband with substitutes.</li>
        <li>Where possible use a tracking device, but be aware of their limitations (range, battery life, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the substance is suspicious but not regulated in your country (e.g., caffeine), consider performing a
        monitored delivery to gather additional intelligence about its destination and potential for illicit use.</p>
